# Pokemon
A fake-Pokemon game with both server and client.

## Libiary dependencies:
* cocos2d-x-3.13.1
* boost_1_62_0
* mysql-connector-c++-1.1.7-win32

All the directory is designed for the client except fot the GameServer directory.

*I cannot recovery my mysql database, so I lost my database schemas though I know it is necessary to commit the database creation scripts.*
