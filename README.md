# Pokemon
A fake-Pokemon game with both server and client.

## Library dependencies:
* cocos2d-x-3.13.1

  *To build the project, please do put the cocos files in the **cocos2d** directory*
* boost_1_62_0
* mysql-connector-c++-1.1.7-win32

All the directory is designed for the client except for the GameServer directory.

>*I cannot recovery my mysql database, so I lost my database schemas though I know it is necessary to commit the database creation scripts.*

I finally managed to recover the *initpokemon* table and *pokemon* table and update the table creation script.
